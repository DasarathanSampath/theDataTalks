**Benjamin Graham** stated that the defensive investor should have
at least 25% of his portfolio on stock market and the percentage of stock
market value should change based on bond yield and stock yield for both
defensive investor and enterprising investor, which would justify an
all-bond policy.

There is no set of definite rules, how an investment will behave, but
all the investors supposed to buy equities at a lower price and sell them
at a higher price, but most of them end up getting it reverse.

The above line chart shows the performance of 10-years bond yield in
India and nifty50 total yiled. Nifty50 total yield is the sum of
dividend yield & nifty50 stock earnings yield.

10-Year Bond yield = Coupen rate (OR) the interest earned from the bond
value   
Nifty50 Total yield = Dividedn yield + Stock earning yield   
Dividen yield = Dividend received / share price (%)  
Stock earnings yield = EPS/share price (%)  
EPS = Earnings/Share
