Let,

x1, x2, x3, x4, .... xn are observations of a population and 'n' beign the total number of observations, then   

**Populations mean**

\begin{equation}
x' = \mu = {{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+.....+x_{n}} \over n}
\text{    Which is represented as   }
\mu = {{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{n}} \over n}
\end{equation}

**Population vairance**

\begin{equation}
\nu = {{ (x_{1}-\mu) + (x_{2}-\mu) + (x_{3}-\mu) +....+ (x_{n}-\mu)} \over n} 
\text{    Which is represented as   }
\nu = {\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} -\mu) \over n}^2 =  \sigma^2 
\end{equation}

**Population standard deviation**  

$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\nu} = \sqrt{\sigma^2} $$

Suppose n numbr of samplese were taken from the above population &  x_1, x_2, x_3, ... x_n represents each samples then, 

\begin{equation}
\text{   Mean of each samples:   } x_1', x_2', x_3', ... x_n'
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{   Mean of Sample means:   } \mu' = {{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i'} \over n}
\end{equation}    

\begin{equation}
\text{   Variance of sample means:   } \nu' = {{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i'-\mu')^2} \over n}
\end{equation}    

\begin{equation}
\text{   Standard deviation of sample means = Standard deviation of Statistics = Standard Error =   } \sigma' = \sqrt{\nu'} = \sqrt{(\sigma')^2}
\end{equation}

**Mean**  
Average of a population.

**Variance**  
The deviation for set of numbers which are spread out from the population mean. It is the expected squared deviation of a random variable from the population mean.

**Standard Deviation**   
Amount of variability/spread for a population. Higher standard deviation for a population having higher spread.

**Standard Error**  
The deviation between the sample mean and the population mean is called Standard error. Describes how far the sample mean is from the true population mean.
